                    <h2 class="px2 pt-4 pt-md-1 py-2">A brief introduction</h2>
                    <p class="px-3 text-left">I am a (not so young) programming enthusiast on the path to become a Full-Stack developer. Skills which I currently utilise are C# for Back-End and (standard trio) HTML, CSS and JS for Front-End. Other than programming, I enjoy lifting weights, playing sports and watching movies.</p>

                    <h2 class="px-2 py-2">How it led to this</h2>
                    
                        <p class="px-3 text-left">As of young age, I have enjoyed playing video games. Role-Playing games were the <i>the icing on the cake</i> for me as they gave me the opportunity to create and mold characters and situations.</p>
                    
                    <p class="px-3 text-left">All throughout childhood, I have always hated math but really enjoyed physics as it required that I solve (or at least try to) more practical tasks than math did. <i>"If Jack and Peter were 50 kilometers apart and moving to each other while Jack is moving at 30km/h and Peter 45km/h pace; how many seconds would it take for them to meet and how much ground would Peter cover?"</i> just seemed much more appealing than <i>"the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, prove it!</i>; Ammm, can't you just trust me on this one?</p>
                    <p class="px-3 text-left">Past five years, having all of my work activities performed over a computer, made me realise how many repetitions are performed (opening particular set of web pages, logging into particular programs, etc...) on daily basis, with some even repeating multiple times throughout a day; there had to be a less time consuming way.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2 class="px-2 py-2">Why programming ?</h2>
                    <p class="px-3 text-left">While learning basics of procedural programming, it was rather dull. Going through various loops for the purpose of solving basic mathematical tasks did not yield much enthusiams from me. With first I/O lession, slowly, it all started changing. Now, I was able to create, populate and edit files. I have created something which in turn created something else.</p> 
                    <p class="px-3 text-left">With just a glance at every new framework, possibilities exponentionally grew. Not long after, I was able to automatise my daily working routine. Instead of spending minutes, reading logs to check software and hardware status level of each unit (50+ times a day), I was able to get status with errors reported to me and stored for later use, only a click away.Fascinated with possibilities, I have enrolled in a C# course at a local academy and at that point I knew that programming is the path I will enjoy walking.</p>
